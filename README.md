## Django project to handle user authentication 


## Users could perform the following operations:
    register (with username or email)
    login
    logout 
    change password 
    reset password 
    edit their profiles

Note: I took a lot of idea from this book **Django 2 by Example - By Antonio Mel√©**

Here are some screensshot from the project
